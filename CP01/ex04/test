This here is Vegenakki. When Vegenakki went to a store to buy some more vegenakkis.
As Vegenakki was making vegenakki soup, they realised that they had forgotten to buy kaurakerma.
Sad Vegenakki had no other choise than to take their Vegenakki bike and bike back to the store,
passing vegenakki shelf to buy the kaurakerma they had forgotten. When they returned home, their vegenakki soup
had burned down. And so was Vegenakki hungry and without any vegenakki soup. The end.
